# Python-Work-Scheduler
The purpose of this repository is to create a Python program that will automatically create a schedule for different
amount of workers and various commitments necessary.

## Programming Language and Tools Used
1) Python as the main programming language
2) Juypter Notebooks to hold in documentation format.
3) Hosted on Google Colab for User Interface.

## Motivation
I was motivated to create this scheduler application as there are many times to many inconsistencies when a work
schedule has been, either due to inefficient placement of personnel resources, poor understanding of scheduling, etc.

This application allows for a fair work schedule for all employees.

## Deliverables
1) User Interface via Google Colab allowing for custom input of the necessary information needed to create a schedule.
2) Excel Spreadsheet of schedule.
